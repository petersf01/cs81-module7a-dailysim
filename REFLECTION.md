# Reflection â€“ Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I added some personal things like bike riding and hot choclate since I don't drink coffee anymore.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
I didn't notice any unexpected behavior, suprisingly it worked after I got the names correct.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
The nice thing about this is the page loads and things continue in the background.

## What creative element did you add?
Yes a random delay and a bug.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
It flows similar to how time passes in a regular day.
